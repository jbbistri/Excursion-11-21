# Excursion-11-21
What I liked about this excursion:
  I liked that purchasing an amiibo can enhance your overall gameplay experience(able to customize and weaponize them which I can only believe is to the players benefit.)  Provides a fun experience for the player.
 What did I dislike?
    The idea is cool but I wonder how far the amiibo can go in terms of leveling up?  
How could this be made better?
    Maybe not having to go out and purchase an amiibo.  Instead just having the experience already put into the game so everyone who purchases the game can enjoy.  
    Who has the agency?(user or machine?)
Concepts covered
  Audience-people who play super smash bros
  Data- user's playstyle
  Design- applicable to other consoles
  Usability- replicate techniques, entertainment
